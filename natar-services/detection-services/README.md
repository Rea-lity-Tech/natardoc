# Detections

## Marker detections 

Markers are also called "matrix codes" because they consist of an array of black and white squares arranged in a square. We compared a few of them, and Aruco and ChiliTags are above all and equivalent in 2018 in our testing conditions. 

* [Aruco](aruco.md): 3D positions, and number. 
* [ChiliTags](chilitags.md): 3D positions, and number.
* [ARToolkitPlus](chilitags.md): 3D positions \(larger markers\) and number. 

## Circle detections 

* [Circle detection](circle-detection.md): 2D positions, and identification.

## QR codes and bar codes

* [QRÂ Codes](qr-codes-and-barcodes.md): 3D positions and data or text. 
* [Barcodes](qr-codes-and-barcodes.md): data only.
