## Natar: the meta Augmented Reality Toolkit

Natar is an open source project which ambition is to provide the best tools to developpers and experience to customers. The initial focus is to power the **Natar** devices by **RealityTech**. 

It is a “meta” toolkit because it includes existing libraries, 3D engines and tracking algorithms and unites them with a communication protocol. 

#### Open by nature. 

Augmented Reality is young and vast field of study and experiment. In order to properly augment the real world, one should understand it and model it. This **infinite problem** is solved step by step with new detection algorithms \(tags, natural features, deep neural networks...\), better tracking and display technologies. Each step makes the AR better. The creation of an open protocol enables to focus on one challenge at a time.
